It appears on the student's certificate along with the earned points, percentage, and overall graduation classification. CGPA is calculated as follows:\n\nCGPA = Σ (Grade Points of each course × Credits of the course) / Total Credits earned across all terms\n\nThe general CGPA criteria for achieving academic honors are as follows:\n- To be awarded honors, a student must complete their studies within the normal graduation period, which typically does not exceed 8 regular academic semesters.\n- The student must achieve a minimum GPA of 3.667 or higher.\n- The student's cumulative GPA in any academic semester should not fall below 3.00.\n- The student must not have failed any course during their studies at the college or any college from which they transferred, provided that their study period does not exceed two years in the transferring college."
